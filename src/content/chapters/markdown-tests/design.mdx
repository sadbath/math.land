This page demonstrates all the standard Markdown and custom component capabilities available in this project.



## Custom Inline Components

These components are designed to be used within paragraphs of text.

### Highlight & Emph

The <Emph>Emph</Emph> component adds a subtle squiggle emphasis. The <Highlight color="yellow">Highlight</Highlight> component makes text stand out with an italic, bold style. You can change the color to <Highlight color="pink">pink</Highlight>, <Highlight color="green">green</Highlight>, or <Highlight color="blue">blue</Highlight>.

### Custom Link Component

This component handles different types of links automatically.
- Internal Page Link: <Link href="/chapters/adv-func/1-polynomials" type="name">Polynomials Intro</Link>
- External Site Link: <Link href="https://astro.build" type="external">Astro Docs</Link>
- Squiggle Link (default): <Link href="/">Home Page</Link>

## Custom Block Components

These are larger components that structure content on the page.

### Rule Lists

These are great for "do" and "don't" lists.

<RuleList type="good" title="Good Practices:">
    - Use semantic HTML.
    - Write clear and concise content.
    - `code snippets` are automatically styled.
</RuleList>

<RuleList type="bad" title="Bad Practices:">
    - Forgetting to restart the dev server.
    - `mutating state` directly in a reactive framework.
    - Assuming a client-side script will just work.
</RuleList>

### Admonitions

This is the definitive test for our component system.

<Admonition type="note">
    This is a **note**. It's for supplementary information. You can use *Markdown* inside!
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Pro Tip:">
    You can provide a custom title. This is useful for helpful advice or shortcuts.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
    This is a warning. It calls attention to potential pitfalls or important details that should not be overlooked.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="danger">
    This is for critical information. Ignoring this could lead to incorrect results or fundamental misunderstandings.
</Admonition>

## Standard Markdown

Just to be sure, here are the basics.

> This is a standard blockquote, styled differently from our Admonitions.

- An unordered list
- With a few items
1. And a nested
2. ordered list

```javascript
// A standard code block
function test() {
  return "Everything works!";
}
